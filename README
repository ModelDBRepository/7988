Chen N, Ren J, Raymond LA, Murphy TH (2001) Changes in agonist concentration 
dependence that are a function of duration of exposure suggest 
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor nonsaturation during synaptic stimulation. 
Mol Pharmacol 59:212-9 

The mosinit.hoc file constructs a graphical interface for
simulation of the curves from Fig 3a.

The model supports the hypothesis that the kinetics of NMDA receptors (for
two different subunit compositions) delay the binding of glutamate so that
at the time scale of synaptic events less glutamate is bound than would be 
at the constant (equilibrium) glutamate concentration reported in the
literature.  See above paper for more details and references.

These model files (except mosinit.hoc) were supplied by Dr. Tim H. Murphy
A non-substantive change to IVndma5.mod (avoid "exit" call in favor of
"hoc_execerror" in IVnmda5.mod) by Michael Hines allows the model to be
run under mswin.

Some comments from Dr. Murphy's with respect to the model files:
... As we mentioned in the paper we adapted code previously
written by others Mainen, Destexhe to produce the models, we did derive
parameters specific for NR2A and NR2B and adjusted the rate const for 37 C
as well as making exponential and ramping release models..
  The files with temp in the name are at 37 C (rate const adjusted)
  The hoc files with IV in the name are dose response curves.
  The one with ex in the title means exponential rise and fall of transmitter.
  Ramp means ramping up and down of transmitter level.
